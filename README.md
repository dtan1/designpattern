# Design Pattern

This section focuses on some of the key secuirty patterns / principles in Smart Contract Design.  
One of the main reasons is that your code must be able to respond to bugs and vulnerabilities gracefully.

## Key Security Patterns

Some of the Security Design Patterns in smart contracts :
1. Checks Effect Interation pattern
2. Withdrawal (Pull Over Push) pattern
3. Guard Check Pattern
4. Emergency Stop Pattern
   - rate limit
   - speed bump
   - circuit breaker


--------

### 1. Checks Effect Interaction (CEI) pattern :
- secure / right ordering :
  ```
  - check first
  - effects to state variable
  - interaction last
  ```
  - in details :
    - first validating all arguments 
      - throw appropriate errors when arguments do no meet the expected output
    - once validated, then make changes to smart contract states
    - only interact with other smart contract or account in the last step
      - i.e. ensure current contract has finshied executing all its functionalities.

- optimistic method :
  - effects are written down as completed, before they actually took place
  - This is ok as the whole transaction can be reverted (via transfer() call), if effect fails. 

- when to use it ?
  - good for function that needs to make external calls (to other smart contract or account)

- what is it good for or why needed ?
  - avoid re-entrancy attack
    - function that is invoked repeatedly that should be executed once - DAO attack.

### 2. Withdrawal Pattern (Pull Over Push) :
- What
  - distruibute funds over a large number of users / recipients. 

- When
  - distruibute airdrop or dividents, or
  - sending profits of bets to multiple winners, or
  - refund to all participants when target not reached etc

- Why 
  - shift the risk associated with transferring ether to the user / recipient
  - sending ether to another address in ethereum involves a call to receiving entity
    - this external call can potentially fail :
      - the receiving contract could have a fallback function that simply throws an exception
      - run out of gas - lots of external calls within one function call
        - it only needs one of the transfers to fail in order to revert all transfers that already happened and stop the following transfers from executing.
              
- How
  - Push over pull :
    - let each user withdraws (pulls) a certain amount, (rather than being sent to him (push)).
    - this helps to isolate each external call (and shifts the risk of failure from the contract to the user),
  - consists of 3 participants :
    ```
    - entity responsible for initiating of the transfer or issuing the withdrawal notification 
      - (owner of contract or contract itself)
    - smart contract that keeps track of all the balances
    - receipients : each has to actively request for withdrawal
    ```
  - methods :
    - a mapping to keep track of users amount.
      - add entry to mapping if user is new
      - add amount if user already exists
    - user withdraws by issuing a transaction to withdrawal method that uses Check-effects-interaction pattern.
      - i.e. update userâ€™s balance before transferring.

- Note
  - consideration : tradeoff between security and convenience
    - requires user to send additional transaction  (i.e. requesting for withdrawal)
      - higher gas requirement
      - user experience
    - should only be used when there is strong incentive for all participants to withdraw their funds
